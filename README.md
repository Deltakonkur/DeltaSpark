## System Introduction

**DeltaSpark** is an advanced analytical platform that leverages machine learning and optimization algorithms to identify students' weak points and generate a personalized study plan to improve academic performance.

### Main Capabilities:

* Use of combined Ensemble models for higher accuracy
* Automated identification and prioritization of weak topics
* Personalized study plan generation using Genetic Algorithm

## Installation and Setup

### Requirements

* Python 3.8 or higher
* pip (latest version)
* Operating system: Windows/Linux/MacOS

### Install Libraries

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm catboost geneticalgorithm joblib sqlite3
```

Or use the requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the System

```bash
streamlit run delta_spark.py
```

By default, the app will be accessible at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Initial Configuration

1. Register a new student from the sidebar on the main page
2. Enter test data manually or use the "Load Sample Data" button
3. Train the AI model by clicking "Train New Model"
4. Use different tabs for data analysis and receiving the study plan

## Key Features

### Student Management

* Full student profiles including name, major, and academic goals
* Data stored in an SQLite database
* Sample data generation for testing

### AI Models

* Advanced models: XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost
* Combined Ensemble model for improved accuracy
* Manual threshold adjustment for weakness detection

### Analysis and Reporting

* Interactive charts with Plotly for data visualization
* Complete classification reports
* Progress trend analysis over time

### Study Planning

* Genetic Algorithm for optimizing study time allocation
* Weekly total study hours customization
* Customized recommendations for each type of weakness

## System Architecture

### Layers of the System

1. **Data Layer**: SQLite Database
2. **Processing Layer**: Python & ML Models
3. **Presentation Layer**: Streamlit UI

### Workflow

1. Data Entry: test scores, study hours, and student info
2. Preprocessing: encoding and normalization of data
3. Model Training: machine learning models trained on data
4. Weakness Analysis: models identify and prioritize weaknesses
5. Plan Optimization: genetic algorithm distributes study time among topics
6. Results Display: visual reports and study plans
